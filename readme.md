## Overview

An Image uploader, I use MERN stack to create this web application.

In this, you can drag & drop or you can choose to select an image from your folder to upload and you will see a loader while uploading.

For uploading images on the server-side I use the Multer npm package

When the image is uploaded, you can see the image and copy the image URL to your clipboard.
And if an image is not uploaded you will see an error message.
